Updated API docs can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18y67d3V0MjWw2tiGwqK-8LkG6fQ78yyeiyaRdMhW8jU/edit#heading=h.y03xr5ipv4l1)
# TODO:
API calls needed for the next iteration are have a ⭐

Implement lambda functions for...
- [ ] Venue Manager:
    - [ ] /listBlocks: list the blocks for a show
    - [ ] /createBlock: create a block for a show
    - [x] /deleteBlock: delete a block for a show
    - [ ] ⭐ /activateShow: activate a show with a valid configuration
    - [ ] ⭐ /deleteShow: deletes a show if it's inactive
    - [ ] /getShowReport: generate a report for a single show
- [ ]  ⭐ Consumer:
    - [x] ⭐ /searchShows: returns a lists of shows based on a search query
    - [ ] ⭐ /listActiveShows: lists all active shows in all venues
    - [ ] ⭐ /listAvailableSeats: lists all available seats for a show
    - [ ] ⭐ /purchaseSeats: purchases the seats a consumer has selected if they are all available
- [ ]  Administrator:
    - [ ] ⭐ /getShowsReport: generate a report for all the shows in a venue
    - [ ] ⭐ /deleteShow: deletes a show regardless if it's inactive (same API the one in venue manager, but different functionality)

There will also probably be some more lambda functions that'll come up as we work on these
